# Ember
This project started as a small attempt to recreate some machine learning primitives from 
scratch in Kotlin.
I quickly realized while doing research that I could fairly easily build a small set of primitives
to build larger components and scale up complexity rapidly. At the same time that I was
learning about different optimization and visualization techniques for my own use, I realized
they would make fantastic learning tools for others as well.
